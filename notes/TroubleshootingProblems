So far we have found a problem with the layout for the domain on the mobile side

when ever we find issues like this we should try to isolate the issue 
the better we do this the faster we can find the cause and fix it 

so the best thing to do is to create a playground.html and
get a basic template going and copy the stylesheet from the index 

so this is where we are going to work in isolation from the index.html 
so we are seperating the problem from the main site so we can work on it 

the first thing that we notice is that all the other screens but mobile are working correctly 

next we are going to want to delete other elements around the issue to see that if that is causing the problem

after some investigating it seems to be a problem when we hit a certian breakpoint 
the white box goes under the button 

so this seems to be the problem the input box seems to be larger than its parent 
this is happening because chrome gave a default width to .input-group .input 
so our flex grow property can not do its job
