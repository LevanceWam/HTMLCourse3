This is the notes for color palette

before we start building our components 
we need to define our color palette 

Color palettes often include a:
    - Primary color
    - secondary color
    - accent color 

We can have additional colors but it is important to identify these colors first 
if we look at the photoshop markup of our site the design is centered around blue 

so in our stylesheet we are going to 
define our color palette using css variables
