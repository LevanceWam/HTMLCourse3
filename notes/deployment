#Deployment:

Now we are going to deploy the website 
to do this we are going to use a service called: netlify https://www.netlify.com/

so create a account and we go from there 

1. click the sites tab and click the new site from git
2. second click the git supporter that suits you (for us it is github)
3. select the repo you want to use 
4. look over the next page settings to see if it is correct 
5. next set the build settings which are 
    * parcel build index.html
    * for the publish directory we are going to use dist 
6. Deploy site

** NOTE ** 
I had to update to parcel 1.12.5 because on netlify
i kept recieving a error and after doing some research 
either downgrading or updating will fix the issue
