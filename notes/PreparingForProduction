Now we are going to get our site ready for production
this is where we need to use a Build Tool

##Build Tool
Using a build tool we can combine multiple JS and CSS files
we do this so we can reduce the number of HTTP request sent from the browser to the server

we can also minify our CSS and JS files removing all the extra space and comments
and unnessacry charaters this will help us deliver smaller files to the user 

we can also optimize images 

** Some popular tools:
webpack (This is a little complicated lots of configuration)
Rollup
parcel

we are going to look into parcel 
https://parceljs.org/

** Important Steps ** 
first we need to install node if we do not have it

the in vs code open terminal

* npm init -y 
* npm i -D parcel-bundler
the captial d is for devdepency this is not going to be deployed with our project 

* add .gitignore and add the node folder 

## Using parcel to launch the site 

now back in terminal 

go to:

node_modules/.bin/parcel (don't execute yet)

this is where the the binary or executable files of the third party libraries 
are installed

then add the agrument index.html
so it should look like this all together:

node_modules/.bin/parcel index.html (do not execute)
there is a way to make this shorter 

first install parcel globally 

sudo npm i -g parcel-bundler

now we can call parcel from any folder and launch the site just like this 

parcel index.html

parcel comes with its own development server that is running on localhost:1234
now the site is running on parcel server not live server 
remember to use parcel's server we have to go into terminal and run that command 

the server comes with live reloading so any changes that we make will show up immediately

** adding more to the .gitignore

parcel added 2 new folders that it need to build our site 
we do not want this on our git repo

add them to .gitignore

## Build for production

now we are going to stop the parcel server and start the build the site 
crtl c to stop the server 

then we are going to type the command:
*  parcel build index.html

I had to add a .htmlnanorc and some code to get the build to work
